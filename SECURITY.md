## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Research Integrity Issues

If you discover any issues related to:
- Mathematical errors in proofs
- Computational vulnerabilities in code
- Data integrity problems
- Academic misconduct concerns

Please report them through:

1. **GitHub Issues** for non-sensitive mathematical corrections
2. **Private Contact** for serious academic integrity concerns
3. **Academic Channels** for peer review feedback

### For Technical Security Issues

If you find security vulnerabilities in any computational code:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. **Contact privately** through repository maintainer
3. **Provide detailed description** of the vulnerability
4. **Allow reasonable time** for response and fix

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Depends on complexity, typically 2-4 weeks
